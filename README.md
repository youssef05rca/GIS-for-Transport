Exploring Leeds Accident Data: Analyzing spatial distribution, population density, and temporal patterns of accidents in the Leeds region. Visualizations and insights for road safety

# Introduction


This project aims to analyze and visualize accident data in the Leeds region. By combining geospatial information, accident statistics, and population density data, we'll uncover insights into the distribution of accidents, their correlation with population density, and their temporal patterns. Throughout the notebook, we'll leverage libraries such as Geopandas, Matplotlib, Folium, and Pandas to process, visualize, and interpret the data.

# Key Goals:

- Analyze the spatial distribution of accidents within the Leeds region.
- Investigate the relationship between accidents and population density.
- Explore temporal patterns of accidents throughout the week.
- Create interactive maps for better visualization and understanding.
